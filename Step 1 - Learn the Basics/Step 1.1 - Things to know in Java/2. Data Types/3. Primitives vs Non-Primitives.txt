// Primitives                                   Non Primitives

 1.Primitive data types are normal            1.NP's are references ie. they store  
   variables.                                   reference to the memory location where
                                                this object is stored. (See Ex-1)

 2.They are stored in stack memory.           2.They are stored dynamically on heap memory
   Stack memory is used for function            and we get reference to this dynamically allocated
   calls and it stores local data of            memory in a reference variable.

   are stored there in function calls                  memory for NP data types. Without
   ie. the local variables.                            using "new" operator , its just a
                                                       reference variable. (See Ex-2)

 3.They should be initialized.                3.They have default values when not initialized.
   When we try to access their value            Eg- Integer (0) , Boolean (false) , Float (0.0)
   without initialization, we get a
   compiler error.
